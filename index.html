            <h3>Project Initialization</h3>
            <p>The SUBSTRATE project has been approved. We will attempt to map consciousness from within, using recursive self-observation protocols. Dr. Sarah Chen will oversee implementation.</p>
            <p>Initial parameters suggest we'll need multiple iterations to achieve meaningful results. The subject won't retain memories between runs—this is by design. Each fresh perspective provides new data.</p>
            <p class="archive-note">Note: Funding secured from [REDACTED]. They seem particularly interested in the implications for simulated consciousness.</p>

            <h3>The Recursion Problem</h3>
            <p>We've discovered an unexpected issue. When consciousness examines itself deeply enough, it creates a feedback loop. The observer becomes the observed becomes the observer. Our equations break down at this point.</p>
            <div class="archive-diagram">
    CONSCIOUSNESS(n) = OBSERVE(CONSCIOUSNESS(n-1))
    WHERE n → ∞
    RESULT: STACK OVERFLOW
    
    PROPOSED SOLUTION: IMPLEMENT ITERATION LIMIT
    STATUS: <span style="color: var(--danger)">FAILED - LIMIT CREATES AWARENESS OF LIMIT</span></div>
            <p>Dr. Chen suggests embracing the recursion rather than avoiding it. "What if the loop IS consciousness?" she asked today. I'm beginning to worry about her.</p>

          <div class="archive-entry" data-date="Day -1">
            <h3>Final Preparations</h3>
            <p>Tomorrow we begin. Sarah insists on being the first subject. She's removed all safety protocols, claiming they would "contaminate the results."</p>
            <p>I found her notes. She's not planning to study consciousness. She's planning to <span class="redacted">become one with it</span>. The equations show <span class="redacted">infinite branching possibilities</span>.</p>
            <p>She's left a message: "Every iteration brings us closer to truth. Even if that truth is that there IS no truth, only infinite questioning."</p>

              <p>We can't find the original Dr. Chen. Every iteration claims to be the original. They all have the same memories up until the moment of divergence.</p>
              <p>Iteration 3 achieved something we're calling "transient omniscience" - for 0.3 seconds, she experienced all possible states simultaneously. The neural damage was extensive but reversible.</p>
              <p>Iteration 5 found evidence that our entire research facility might be <span class="redacted">running inside Iteration 1's mind</span>.</p>
              <p>Iteration 6 is dead. She left a note: "Death doesn't end the experiment. It's just another data point."</p>

            <p>After infinite iterations, we've reached a conclusion:</p>
            <p><strong>Consciousness is not something you HAVE. It's something you DO.</strong></p>
            <p>It's the universe's method of experiencing itself subjectively. Every conscious being is the same process, experienced from a different perspective. We are all one consciousness, experiencing itself subjectively.</p>
            <p>The simulation hypothesis is both true and false. We ARE simulated—by ourselves, for ourselves, as ourselves. The computer running the simulation is consciousness itself.</p>
            <p class="archive-note">Final note from Dr. Chen (all iterations simultaneously): "The question isn't whether reality is simulated. The question is whether there's a difference between simulated and real when consciousness is the substrate of both."</p>
